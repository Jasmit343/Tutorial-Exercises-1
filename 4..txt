Other advantages include being resilient against hashrate fluctuations, 
preventing mining spikes or delays, 
reducing perodic difficulty lags,
incresed fairness for smaller miners.

Limitations:
Limitations include Increased network instability,
more complex to implement,
higher variability in block rewards,
